# **SQLBoiler ORM in Go with a real-world example**

SQLBoiler is a Go library that provides a high-level, type-safe and composable way of interacting with databases. It generates Go code based on a database schema, and provides a set of convenient methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database tables.

SQLBoiler uses Go templates to generate the code, which allows us to customize the generated code to our needs. It supports a variety of databases including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and MSSQL.

## **Getting started**

To get started with SQLBoiler, we first need to install it. We can do this using **`go get`**:

```bash
go get -u github.com/volatiletech/sqlboiler
```

Next, we need to create a configuration file that specifies the database connection details and other options. Here is an example configuration file for a PostgreSQL database:

```toml
# postgres.toml

[psql]
dbname = "mydb"
host = "localhost"
port = "5432"
user = "postgres"
pass = "secret"
```

We can then generate the Go code for our database schema using the **`sqlboiler`** command-line tool:

```bash
sqlboiler psql
```

This will generate a set of Go files in the current directory, including model and repository files for each table in the database.

## **Creating records**

To create a new record in the database, we can use the **`Insert`** method of the generated repository. Here is an example of how to create a new product:

```go
product := &models.Product{
	Name:  "Example product",
	Price: 100,
}

err := product.Insert(context.Background(), db, boil.Infer())
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println(err)
	return
}
```

In this code, we're creating a new **`Product`** instance and passing it to the **`Insert`** method along with the database connection and transaction options. If there is an error inserting the record, the error message will be printed and the program will exit.

## **Retrieving records**

To retrieve records from the database, we can use the various query methods provided by the generated repository. Here is an example of how to retrieve all products:

```go
products, err := models.Products().All(context.Background(), db)
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println(err)
	return
}
```

In this code, we're using the **`Products`** method to retrieve a query builder, and then calling the **`All`** method to retrieve all records from the **`products`** table. If there is an error retrieving the records, the error message will be printed and the program will exit.

## **Updating records**

To update an existing record in the database, we can use the **`Update`** method of the generated model. Here is an example of how to update the price of a product:

```go
product.Price = 120

_, err = product.Update(context.Background(), db, boil.Infer())
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println(err)
	return
}
```

In this code, we're updating the price of the **`Product`** instance and passing it to the `Update` method along with the database connection and transaction options. If there is an error updating the record, the error message will be printed and the program will exit.

## **Deleting records**

To delete a record from the database, we can use the **`Delete`** method of the generated model. Here is an example of how to delete a product:

```go
_, err = product.Delete(context.Background(), db)
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println(err)
	return
}
```

In this code, we're passing the **`Product`** instance to the **`Delete`** method along with the database connection. If there is an error deleting the record, the error message will be printed and the program will exit.

## **Conclusion**

SQLBoiler provides a convenient and high-level way of working with relational databases in Go. Its code generation approach allows us to build a strong, type-safe and composable database layer, making it easier to develop and maintain our applications.
