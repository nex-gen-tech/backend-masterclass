# **Go-pg ORM in Golang with Real-World Examples**

Go-pg is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Golang that provides a simple and elegant way to interact with PostgreSQL databases. It eliminates the need for writing raw SQL statements and provides a convenient way to work with databases in Golang. In this article, we'll cover the basics of using Go-pg and provide some real-world examples to demonstrate how it can be used.

## **Installation**

To install Go-pg, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go get github.com/go-pg/pg
```

## **Connecting to a database**

To connect to a database, you first need to import the **`github.com/go-pg/pg`** package and then use the **`Connect`** method to establish a connection. The following code connects to a PostgreSQL database:

```bash
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/go-pg/pg"
)

func main() {
	db := pg.Connect(&pg.Options{
		User:     "user",
		Password: "password",
		Database: "database",
	})
	defer db.Close()
}
```

In this example, the **`Connect`** method is passed an instance of **`pg.Options`** that contains the information needed to establish a connection to the database, such as the database user, password, and database name.

## **Executing Queries**

Go-pg provides several methods for executing queries, including **`Exec`**, **`Query`**, and **`QueryOne`**.

### **Exec**

The **`Exec`** method is used to execute a SQL statement that doesn't return any rows, such as an **`INSERT`**, **`UPDATE`**, or **`DELETE`** statement. The following example inserts a new record into the **`users`** table:

```go
_, err := db.Exec("INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (?, ?)", "John Doe", "john.doe@example.com")
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println(err)
	return
}
```

### **Query**

The **`Query`** method is used to execute a SQL statement that returns multiple rows, such as a **`SELECT`** statement without a **`LIMIT`** clause. The following example retrieves all users from the **`users`** table:

```go
var users []struct {
	ID    int64  `db:"id"`
	Name  string `db:"name"`
	Email string `db:"email"`
}

err := db.Query(&users, "SELECT * FROM users")
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println(err)
	return
}
```

### **QueryOne**

The **`QueryOne`** method is used to execute a SQL statement that returns a single row, such as a **`SELECT`** statement with a **`LIMIT`** clause. The following example retrieves a single user from the **`users`** table based on their email address:

```go
var user struct {
	ID    int64  `db:"id"`
	Name  string `db:"name"`
	Email string `db:"email"`
}

err := db.QueryOne(&user, "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?", "john.doe@example.com
```

### **Select**

The **`Select`** method is used to execute a SQL query that returns multiple rows, such as a **`SELECT`** statement without a **`LIMIT`** clause. The following example retrieves all users from the **`users`** table:

```go
var users []User

err := db.Model(&users).Select()
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to retrieve users: %v", err)
}
```

In this example, **`db.Model`** creates a new query for the **`User`** type. The **`Select`** method is then called on the query to retrieve all records from the **`users`** table and store the result in the **`users`** slice.

### **Insert**

To insert a new record into the database, you can use the **`Insert`** method. The following example inserts a new user into the **`users`** table:

```go
user := &User{
    Name:  "John Doe",
    Email: "john.doe@example.com",
}

err := db.Insert(user)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to insert user: %v", err)
}
```

In this example, a new **`User`** struct is created and its fields are initialized. The **`Insert`** method is then called on the **`db`** object to insert the new record into the **`users`** table.

### **Update**

To update an existing record in the database, you can use the **`Update`** method. The following example updates the name of a user:

```go
user := &User{
    ID:    1,
    Name:  "Jane Doe",
}

err := db.Update(user)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to update user: %v", err)
}
```

In this example, a **`User`** struct is created with its **`ID`** field set to **`1`** and the **`Name`** field updated to **`Jane Doe`**. The **`Update`** method is then called on the **`db`** object to update the corresponding record in the **`users`** table.

### **Delete**

To delete a record from the database, you can use the **`Delete`** method. The following example deletes a user based on its ID:

```go
user := &User{
    ID: 1,
}

err := db.Delete(user)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to delete user: %v", err)
}
```

In this example, a **`User`** struct is created with its **`ID`** field set to **`1`**. The **`Delete`** method is then called on the **`db`** object to delete the corresponding record from the **`users`** table.

### **Conclusion**

Go-pg is a powerful and flexible ORM for Golang that makes it easy to interact with databases. With its simple and intuitive API, you can perform a wide range of database operations, such as executing queries, inserting, updating, and deleting records, without having to write raw SQL statements. Whether you're working on a small project or a large-scale application, Go-pg is an excellent choice for your database needs.
