# **GORM - Object Relational Mapping (ORM) in Go**

GORM is a powerful and widely used ORM library for Go that provides a simple, elegant API for working with relational databases. In this guide, we will explore the basics of GORM and how to use it to perform common CRUD operations in Go.

## **What is GORM**

GORM is an open-source library that provides a simple, elegant API for working with relational databases in Go. It abstracts the complexity of working with databases, allowing developers to write clean, concise code that is easier to maintain and understand.

GORM supports a wide range of databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MSSQL, making it a versatile choice for many projects.

## **Why use GORM**

There are several reasons why you might choose to use GORM for your Go projects:

1. Increased Productivity: GORM makes it easier to work with relational databases by abstracting the complexity of database operations. This leads to increased productivity and reduces the risk of bugs and errors.
2. Improved Code Quality: GORM provides a clean, concise API that makes it easier to write clean, maintainable code.
3. Better Performance: GORM is designed to be highly performant, and provides several optimization options to ensure that your database operations are as fast as possible.

## **Getting started with GORM**

To get started with GORM, you first need to install the library:

```bash
go get -u gorm.io/gorm
```

Next, you need to create a new database connection:

```go
import (
	"gorm.io/driver/mysql"
	"gorm.io/gorm"
)

func main() {
	// Connect to the database
	db, err := gorm.Open(mysql.Open("root:password@/database?charset=utf8mb4&parseTime=True&loc=Local"), &gorm.Config{})
	if err != nil {
		panic("failed to connect database")
	}
	defer db.Close()
}
```

Replace **`root:password@/database`** with your own database credentials.

## **Creating a new model**

With a database connection established, we can now create a new model. A model in GORM represents a table in your database. To create a new model, you need to define a Go struct with fields that correspond to the columns in your table:

```go
type Product struct {
	gorm.Model
	Name  string
	Price uint
}
```

The **`gorm.Model`** field provides several fields for common database operations, such as **`ID`**, **`CreatedAt`**, **`UpdatedAt`**, and **`DeletedAt`**.

## **Creating a new table**

With our model defined, we can now create a new table in the database:

```go
db.AutoMigrate(&Product{})
```

The **`AutoMigrate`** method creates a new table in the database with the fields defined in the **`Product`** struct.

## **Creating a new record**

To create a new record in the **`Product`** table, we simply need to create a new instance of the **`Product`** struct and call the **`Create`** method:

```
product := Product{
	Name:  "Product 1",
	Price: 100,
}
db.Create(&product)
```

[data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)

This will insert a new record into the `Product` table with the `Name` and `Price` values provided.

### Retrieving records

To retrieve records from the `Product` table, we can use the `Find` method:

```go
var products []Product
db.Find(&products)
```

This will retrieve all records from the **`Product`** table and store them in the **`products`** slice.

You can also retrieve specific records by using the **`Where`** method:

```go
var product Product
db.Where("name = ?", "Product 1").First(&product)
```

This will retrieve the first record from the **`Product`** table where the **`Name`** column is equal to "Product 1".

## **Updating records**

To update a record in the **`Product`** table, we can use the **`Save`** method:

```go
product.Name = "Updated Product 1"
db.Save(&product)
```

This will update the **`Name`** column of the **`product`** instance and save it to the database.

## **Deleting records**

To delete a record from the **`Product`** table, we can use the **`Delete`** method:

```go
db.Delete(&product)
```

This will delete the **`product`** instance from the database.

## **Conclusion**

In this guide, we have covered the basics of using GORM to perform CRUD operations in Go. GORM provides a simple, elegant API that makes it easy to work with relational databases, and is a powerful tool for any Go project.
