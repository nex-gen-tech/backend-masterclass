# **XORM: An ORM for Go**

XORM is a popular Object Relational Mapping (ORM) library for the Go programming language. It provides a simple and intuitive API for working with databases, making it easier to perform common database operations like creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting records.

In this guide, we will walk through a real-world example of using XORM to interact with a PostgreSQL database.

## **Setting up the environment**

To use XORM in your project, you first need to install it. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
go get -u github.com/go-xorm/xorm
```

Next, create a new Go file for your project and import the XORM library:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	_ "github.com/lib/pq"
	"github.com/go-xorm/xorm"
)
```

In this example, we're using the **`pq`** library to connect to a PostgreSQL database.

## **Connecting to the database**

Next, we need to connect to the database using the following code:

```go
func main() {
	db, err := xorm.NewEngine("postgres", "user=postgres password=secret dbname=postgres sslmode=disable")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	defer db.Close()
```

In this code, we're creating a new XORM engine using the **`postgres`** driver and providing the necessary connection details. If there is an error connecting to the database, the error message will be printed and the program will exit.

## **Defining the model**

To interact with the database, we first need to define a model that represents our data. In this example, we will be working with a **`Product`** table with the following columns:

- **`ID`**: the primary key
- **`Name`**: the name of the product
- **`Price`**: the price of the product

Here's the Go code for the **`Product`** model:

```go
type Product struct {
	ID int64 `xorm:"pk autoincr"`
	Name string `xorm:"varchar(255)"`
	Price float64
}
```

In this code, we're using XORM's tag syntax to define the columns and their properties. The **`pk`** tag is used to specify that the **`ID`** column is the primary key, and the **`autoincr`** tag is used to specify that it should be auto-incremented.

## **Creating records**

To insert a new record into the **`Product`** table, we can use the **`Insert`** method:

```go
product := Product{
	Name: "Product 1",
	Price: 100,
}
_, err = db.Insert(&product)
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println(err)
	return
}
```

In this code, we're creating a new **`Product`** instance and passing it to the **`Insert`** method. If there is an error inserting the record, the error message will be printed and the program will exit.

## **Retrieving records**

To retrieve records from the **`Product`** table, we can use the `Find

```go
var products []Product
err = db.Find(&products)
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println(err)
	return
}
```

In this code, we're using the **`Find`** method to retrieve all records from the **`Product`** table and store them in the **`products`** slice. If there is an error retrieving the records, the error message will be printed and the program will exit.

## **Updating records**

To update an existing record in the **`Product`** table, we can use the **`Update`** method:

```go
product.Price = 120
_, err = db.Update(&product)
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println(err)
	return
}
```

In this code, we're updating the price of the **`Product`** instance and passing it to the **`Update`** method. If there is an error updating the record, the error message will be printed and the program will exit.

## **Deleting records**

To delete a record from the **`Product`** table, we can use the **`Delete`** method:

```go
_, err = db.Delete(&product)
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println(err)
	return
}
```

In this code, we're passing the **`Product`** instance to the **`Delete`** method. If there is an error deleting the record, the error message will be printed and the program will exit.

## **Conclusion**

In this guide, we have seen how to perform CRUD operations on a PostgreSQL database using XORM, a popular ORM library for Go. By using XORM, we can simplify the process of working with databases and make our code more readable and maintainable.
