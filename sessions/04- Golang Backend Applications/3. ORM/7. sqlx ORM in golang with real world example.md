# **SQLx ORM in Golang with Real-World Examples**

SQLx is a package that provides an extended version of the Go database/sql package. It's an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library that makes working with databases in Golang much easier. It provides a simple, yet powerful, way to interact with databases using Go, eliminating the need for writing raw SQL statements. This article will go through the basics of using SQLx and provide some real-world examples of how it can be used to interact with databases in Golang.

### **Installation**

To install SQLx, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go get github.com/jmoiron/sqlx
```

### **Connecting to a database**

To connect to a database, you first need to import the **`sqlx`** package and then use the **`Connect`** method to establish a connection. The following code connects to a SQLite database:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/jmoiron/sqlx"
)

func main() {
	db, err := sqlx.Connect("sqlite3", "./mydb.db")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	defer db.Close()
}
```

In this example, the **`Connect`** method is passed two arguments: the first argument is the database driver name, and the second argument is the connection string. In this case, the database driver is **`sqlite3`** and the connection string is **`./mydb.db`**, which is the path to the SQLite database file.

### **Executing Queries**

SQLx provides several methods for executing queries, including **`Exec`**, **`Get`**, and **`Select`**.

### Exec

The **`Exec`** method is used to execute a SQL statement that doesn't return any rows, such as an **`INSERT`**, **`UPDATE`**, or **`DELETE`** statement. The following example inserts a new record into the **`users`** table:

```go
_, err := db.Exec("INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (?, ?)", "John Doe", "john.doe@example.com")
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println(err)
	return
}
```

### Get

The **`Get`** method is used to execute a SQL statement that returns a single row, such as a **`SELECT`** statement with a **`LIMIT`** clause. The following example retrieves a single user from the **`users`** table based on their email address:

```go
var user struct {
	ID    int64  `db:"id"`
	Name  string `db:"name"`
	Email string `db:"email"`
}

err := db.Get(&user, "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?", "john.doe@example.com")
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println(err)
	return
}
```

### Select

The **`Select`** method is used to execute a SQL statement that returns multiple rows, such as a **`SELECT`** statement without a **`LIMIT`** clause. The following example retrieves all users from the **`users`** table:

and provides a way to map the returned rows to Go structures:

```go
err := db.Select(&users, "SELECT * FROM users")
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println(err)
	return
}
```

These are just some of the basic examples of how SQLx can be used to interact with databases in Golang. SQLx also provides many other useful features, such as transaction management, prepared statements, and more. By using SQLx, you can simplify your database interaction code, increase your productivity, and reduce the likelihood of errors.
