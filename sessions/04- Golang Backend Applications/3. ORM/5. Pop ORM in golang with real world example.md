# **Pop ORM in Go with a real-world example**

Pop ORM is a Go library for working with databases. It provides a high-level, type-safe, and composable way of interacting with databases. Pop ORM is built on top of the sqlx library and provides a simple, easy-to-use API for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database tables.

Pop ORM supports a variety of databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and MSSQL.

## **Getting started**

To get started with Pop ORM, we first need to install it. We can do this using **`go get`**:

```bash
go get -u github.com/gobuffalo/pop
```

Next, we need to create a configuration file that specifies the database connection details and other options. Here is an example configuration file for a PostgreSQL database:

```toml
# postgres.toml

[database]
url = "postgres://postgres:secret@localhost/mydb?sslmode=disable"
```

We can then create a connection to the database using the **`Connection`** function:

```go
conn, err := pop.Connect("postgres.toml")
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println(err)
	return
}
defer conn.Close()
```

In this code, we're passing the path to the configuration file to the **`Connect`** function, which returns a database connection. We're using **`defer`** to close the connection when the function returns.

## **Creating records**

To create a new record in the database, we can use the **`Create`** method of the connection. Here is an example of how to create a new product:

```go
product := &models.Product{
	Name:  "Example product",
	Price: 100,
}

err = conn.Create(product)
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println(err)
	return
}
```

In this code, we're creating a new **`Product`** instance and passing it to the **`Create`** method of the connection. If there is an error inserting the record, the error message will be printed and the program will exit.

## **Retrieving records**

To retrieve records from the database, we can use the various query methods provided by the connection. Here is an example of how to retrieve all products:

```go
var products []models.Product

err = conn.All(&products)
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println(err)
	return
}
```

In this code, we're using the **`All`** method to retrieve all records from the **`products`** table and store them in a slice of **`Product`** structs. If there is an error retrieving the records, the error message will be printed and the program will exit.

## **Updating records**

To update an existing record in the database, we can use the **`Update`** method of the connection. Here is an example of how to update the price of a product:

```go
product.Price = 120

err = conn.Update(product)
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println(err)
	return
}
```

In this code, we're first modifying the **`Price`** field of the **`Product`** struct and then passing it to the **`Update`** method of the connection. If there is an error updating the record, the error message will be printed and the program will exit.

## **Deleting records**

To delete a record from the database, we can use the **`Destroy`** method of the connection. Here is an example of how to delete a product:

```go
err = conn.Destroy(product)
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println(err)
	return
}
```

In this code, we're passing the **`Product`** struct to the **`Destroy`** method of the connection. If there is an error deleting the record, the error message will be printed and the program will exit.

## **Conclusion**

Pop ORM provides a simple and easy-to-use API for working with databases in Go. With its type-safe and composable approach, Pop ORM can help you write clean and maintainable code when interacting with databases. Whether you're working with PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, or MSSQL, Pop ORM has got you covered.
