# **5. Difference between Authentication and Authorization**

Authentication and authorization are two closely related concepts in the field of computer security. While they both refer to the process of determining the identity of a user and granting or denying access to certain resources, there are important differences between the two.

## **Authentication**

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or device. This is done by requiring the user to provide some form of proof of identity, such as a username and password, a smart card, or biometric data. Once the identity of the user has been confirmed, the system can then determine whether the user is authorized to access the requested resource.

## **Authorization**

Authorization, on the other hand, is the process of granting or denying access to a resource based on the user's identity and permissions. Once a user has been authenticated, the authorization process determines what actions the user is allowed to perform on the resource. This may include reading data, updating data, executing certain commands, or accessing specific areas of a website or application.

## **Key Differences**

1. Purpose: The main purpose of authentication is to verify the identity of the user, while the main purpose of authorization is to determine what actions the user is allowed to perform.
2. Scope: Authentication applies to the user or device, while authorization applies to the specific resource or action that the user is attempting to access.
3. Time: Authentication typically occurs only once per session, while authorization may occur multiple times during a single session as the user interacts with different resources.
4. Level of Access: Authentication is a prerequisite for authorization, but authorization can further restrict the level of access granted to the user based on their role, permissions, and other factors.

In conclusion, authentication and authorization are both important components of a secure system, and they work together to ensure that only authorized users are able to access the resources they need.
