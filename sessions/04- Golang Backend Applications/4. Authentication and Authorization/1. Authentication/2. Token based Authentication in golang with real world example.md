# **Token-based Authentication in Golang with a Real-World Example**

Authentication is a critical aspect of security in web applications, as it helps to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive information. Golang provides several authentication methods, one of which is token-based authentication. In this article, we will discuss token-based authentication in Golang and provide a real-world example to demonstrate its implementation.

## **What is Token-based Authentication?**

Token-based authentication is a method where the user provides their credentials to a server, which then sends a token back to the client. This token is used in subsequent requests to access protected resources. The server checks the token against a database of authorized tokens, and if a match is found, the user is granted access. Tokens are unique, encrypted strings that are generated for each user session.

## **Real-World Example**

Let's consider a scenario where a user wants to access a protected resource on a web server. The following steps illustrate the token-based authentication process:

1. The user sends a login request to the server with their username and password.
2. The server verifies the credentials, and if they are correct, it generates a token and sends it back to the user.
3. The user stores the token locally and uses it in subsequent requests to access protected resources on the server.
4. The server receives the request and checks the token against its database of authorized tokens. If a match is found, the server returns the requested resource.

Here is an example of token-based authentication in Golang:

```go
package main

import (
	"crypto/rand"
	"crypto/sha256"
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

var tokens = make(map[string]bool)

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/login", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		username, password, _ := r.BasicAuth()

		if username == "admin" && password == "password" {
			token := generateToken()
			tokens[token] = true
			w.Write([]byte(token))
			return
		}

		w.WriteHeader(http.StatusUnauthorized)
		w.Write([]byte("Unauthorized"))
	})

	http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		token := r.Header.Get("Authorization")

		if tokens[token] {
			w.Write([]byte("Welcome, Admin"))
			return
		}

		w.WriteHeader(http.StatusUnauthorized)
		w.Write([]byte("Unauthorized"))
	})

	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}

func generateToken() string {
	b := make([]byte, 32)
	rand.Read(b)
	return fmt.Sprintf("%x", sha256.Sum256(b))
}

```

In this example, the **`/login`** endpoint handles the user's login request and generates a token if the credentials are correct. The **`/`** endpoint is the protected resource, and it checks the token in the request header against the **`tokens`** map to determine if the user is authorized to access the resource. If a match is found, the user is granted access, and the server returns a welcome message. If the token is not found, the server returns an unauthorized status and message.

It's worth noting that in a real-world scenario, tokens should be stored in a secure database, such as a database of authorized tokens, rather than in memory, as in this example. Additionally, tokens should have an expiration time, and the server should validate the token's expiration before granting access.

## Conclusion

Token-based authentication is a secure and efficient way to authenticate users in web applications. It allows users to access protected resources without having to send their credentials with each request, which helps to keep sensitive information secure. The real-world example in this article provides a basic implementation of token-based authentication in Golang, and it can be modified and expanded to fit the needs of your specific use case.
