# **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Golang**

RBAC is a commonly used method of authorization in Golang, where access to resources is controlled based on the roles of users within an organization. It allows administrators to define roles for users, and then map permissions to these roles.

## **Real-World Example**

Let's consider a scenario where a company has an internal web-based application for managing employee information. The application has different levels of access for different users, as follows:

- HR managers have full access to all employee information and can perform all actions on the system.
- Line managers have access to information about employees who report to them and can perform certain actions, such as updating employee information and viewing reports.
- Regular employees have limited access to the system and can only view their own information.

In this scenario, RBAC can be used to enforce access control. The HR managers would be assigned the role of "HR Manager", line managers would be assigned the role of "Line Manager", and regular employees would be assigned the role of "Employee". Permissions would then be mapped to these roles, so that HR managers have full access to all employee information, line managers have access to information about the employees they manage, and regular employees have limited access to the system.

## **Implementation in Golang**

To implement RBAC in Golang, the following steps can be followed:

1. Define roles: The first step is to define the roles in the system, such as "HR Manager", "Line Manager", and "Employee".
2. Assign roles to users: Next, the roles must be assigned to users. For example, HR managers would be assigned the role of "HR Manager", line managers would be assigned the role of "Line Manager", and regular employees would be assigned the role of "Employee".
3. Map permissions to roles: Once the roles have been defined and assigned, permissions must be mapped to these roles. For example, HR managers would be given full access to all employee information, line managers would be given access to information about the employees they manage, and regular employees would be given limited access to the system.
4. Enforce authorization: Finally, the authorization must be enforced in the application. This can be done using a library or framework, such as Casbin, that supports RBAC in Golang.

In conclusion, RBAC is a powerful authorization mechanism in Golang that can be used to enforce access control in real-world applications. It allows administrators to define roles for users and map permissions to these roles, making it easy to manage access control in a scalable and flexible manner.

## **Implementing RBAC with GORM in Golang**

GORM is a popular ORM library for Golang that provides a simple and convenient way to interact with databases. It can be used to implement RBAC in Golang by creating models to represent the different components of the authorization system, such as users, roles, and permissions.

Here is an example implementation of RBAC with GORM in Golang:

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/jinzhu/gorm"
	_ "github.com/jinzhu/gorm/dialects/sqlite"
)

// User model to represent a user in the system
type User struct {
	gorm.Model
	Username string
	Password string
	Role     Role
	RoleID   uint
}

// Role model to represent a role in the system
type Role struct {
	gorm.Model
	Name        string
	Description string
	Permissions []Permission `gorm:"many2many:role_permissions;"`
}

// Permission model to represent a permission in the system
type Permission struct {
	gorm.Model
	Name        string
	Description string
}

func main() {
	db, err := gorm.Open("sqlite3", "test.db")
	if err != nil {
		panic("Failed to connect to database")
	}
	defer db.Close()

	db.AutoMigrate(&User{}, &Role{}, &Permission{})

	// Create sample roles and permissions
	adminRole := Role{Name: "admin", Description: "Administrator role"}
	db.Create(&adminRole)
	viewPermission := Permission{Name: "view", Description: "Permission to view resources"}
	db.Create(&viewPermission)
	editPermission := Permission{Name: "edit", Description: "Permission to edit resources"}
	db.Create(&editPermission)
	adminRole.Permissions = []Permission{viewPermission, editPermission}
	db.Save(&adminRole)

	// Create sample users
	admin := User{Username: "admin", Password: "secret", Role: adminRole}
	db.Create(&admin)

	// Check user's permissions
	var user User
	db.Where("username = ?", "admin").First(&user)
	for _, permission := range user.Role.Permissions {
		println(permission.Name)
	}
}
```

In this example, we create **`User`**, **`Role`**, and **`Permission`** models to represent the different components of the authorization system. The **`Role`** model has a many-to-many relationship with the **`Permission`** model, allowing us to assign multiple permissions to a single role. The **`User`** model has a one-to-one relationship with the **`Role`** model, allowing us to associate a single role with each user.

We then use GORM to create and manage the relationships between these models, and to perform database operations such as creating new roles, permissions, and users, and retrieving information about users and their permissions.

In conclusion, GORM provides a convenient way to implement RBAC in Golang, making it easy to manage authorization in a scalable and flexible manner.
