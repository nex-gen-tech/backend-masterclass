# **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) Authorization in Golang with a Real-World Example**

Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) is a flexible and powerful authorization model that allows access control decisions to be based on attributes of a user, the resource being accessed, and the context of the request. In ABAC, access is granted or denied based on rules that define the conditions under which access should be granted.

In this section, we will look at a real-world example of ABAC authorization in Golang, using the open-source library **[Casbin](https://github.com/casbin/casbin)**.

## **Installing Casbin**

To install Casbin, you can use the following command:

```bash
go get github.com/casbin/casbin
```

## **Setting Up the Authorization Rules**

Casbin uses an authorization policy language to define the access control rules. In this example, we will define a rule that allows users with the role **`admin`** to access the resource **`/admin`**.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/casbin/casbin"
)

func main() {
	e, err := casbin.NewEnforcer("model.conf", "policy.csv")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// Define the access control rule
	err = e.AddPolicy("admin", "/admin", "GET")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// Check if the user has access
	username := "jane_doe"
	role := "admin"
	path := "/admin"
	method := "GET"

	if e.Enforce(username, path, method) == true {
		fmt.Println("Access granted")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Access denied")
	}
}
```

In this example, we first create a new Casbin enforcer and load the authorization policy from the files **`model.conf`** and **`policy.csv`**. We then define the access control rule using the **`AddPolicy`** method, which takes the parameters **`subject`**, **`object`**, and **`action`**.

Finally, we use the **`Enforce`** method to check if a user with the given **`username`** and **`role`** has access to the **`path`** with the given **`method`**. If the user has access, the code prints "Access granted", otherwise, it prints "Access denied".

## **Adding Attributes to the User and Resource**

In ABAC, we can also add attributes to the user and resource, which can be used to make access control decisions. For example, we can add the attribute **`department`** to the user, and the attribute **`sensitive`** to the resource.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/casbin/casbin"
)

func main() {
	e, err := casbin.NewEnforcer("model.conf", "policy.csv")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// Define the access control rule
	err = e.AddPolicy("admin", "/admin", "GET")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// Add attributes to the user and resource
	e.AddRoleForUser("jane_doe", "admin")
	e.AddNamedPolicy("p", []string{"jane_doe", "/admin", "GET", "engineering"})

	// Check if the user has access
	username := "jane_doe"
	path := "/admin"
	method := "GET"
	department := "engineering"

	if e.Enforce(username, path, method, department) == true {
		fmt.Println("Access granted")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Access denied")
	}
}
```

In this example, we first add the role **`admin`** to the user **`jane_doe`** using the **`AddRoleForUser`** method. We then add the policy using the **`AddNamedPolicy`** method, which takes the parameters **`p`**, **`subject`**, **`object`**, **`action`**, and **`department`**.

Finally, we use the **`Enforce`** method to check if the user has access to the resource, taking into account the added attributes. If the user has access, the code prints "Access granted", otherwise, it prints "Access denied".

## Conclusion

In this example, we have seen how ABAC authorization can be implemented in Golang using the Casbin library. We have demonstrated how to define access control rules based on attributes of the user, resource, and context of the request, and how to enforce these rules to make access control decisions.
