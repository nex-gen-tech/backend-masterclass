# **Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC) Authorization in Golang with a Real-World Example**

Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC) is an authorization model that uses policies to control access to resources. In PBAC, policies are defined in a centralized manner, and access is granted or denied based on the evaluation of these policies.

In this section, we will look at a real-world example of PBAC authorization in Golang, using the open-source library **[Casbin](https://github.com/casbin/casbin)**.

## **Installing Casbin**

To install Casbin, you can use the following command:

```bash
go get github.com/casbin/casbin
```

## **Setting Up the Authorization Policies**

Casbin uses an authorization policy language to define the access control policies. In this example, we will define a policy that allows users with the role **`admin`** to access the resource **`/admin`**.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/casbin/casbin"
)

func main() {
	e, err := casbin.NewEnforcer("model.conf", "policy.csv")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// Define the access control policy
	err = e.AddPolicy("admin", "/admin", "GET")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// Check if the user has access
	username := "jane_doe"
	role := "admin"
	path := "/admin"
	method := "GET"

	if e.Enforce(username, path, method) == true {
		fmt.Println("Access granted")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Access denied")
	}
}
```

In this example, we first create a new Casbin enforcer and load the authorization policy from the files **`model.conf`** and **`policy.csv`**. We then define the access control policy using the **`AddPolicy`** method, which takes the parameters **`subject`**, **`object`**, and **`action`**.

Finally, we use the **`Enforce`** method to check if a user with the given **`username`** and **`role`** has access to the **`path`** with the given **`method`**. If the user has access, the code prints "Access granted", otherwise, it prints "Access denied".

## **Adding Attributes to the User and Resource**

In PBAC, we can also add attributes to the user and resource, which can be used to make access control decisions. For example, we can add the attribute **`department`** to the user, and the attribute **`sensitive`** to the resource.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/casbin/casbin"
)

func main() {
	e, err := casbin.NewEnforcer("model.conf", "policy.csv")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// Define the access control policy
	err = e.AddPolicy("admin", "/admin", "GET")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// Add the user and resource attributes
	e.AddRoleForUser("jane_doe", "admin")
	e.AddNamedPolicy("p", "jane_doe", "/admin", "GET", "department", "finance", "sensitive", "true")

	// Check if the user has access
	username := "jane_doe"
	path := "/admin"
	method := "GET"
	department := "finance"
	sensitive := "true"

	if e.Enforce(username, path, method, department, sensitive) == true {
		fmt.Println("Access granted")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Access denied")
	}
}
```

In this example, we use the **`AddRoleForUser`** and **`AddNamedPolicy`** methods to add the user and resource attributes respectively. The **`AddNamedPolicy`** method takes the parameters **`name`**, **`subject`**, **`object`**, **`action`**, and the attribute-value pairs.

Finally, we use the **`Enforce`** method to check if the user has access, passing the user and resource attributes as additional parameters. If the user has access, the code prints "Access granted", otherwise, it prints "Access denied".

## Conclusion

In this article, we have looked at a real-world example of PBAC authorization in Golang, using the open-source library Casbin. We have seen how to install Casbin, define the authorization policies, and add attributes to the user and resource. This is just a basic example of how to use Casbin for PBAC authorization, and you can extend it to handle more complex authorization scenarios.
