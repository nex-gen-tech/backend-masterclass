# **CRUD Operations with the PostgreSQL Driver Package in Golang**

Go language is a statically typed and concurrent language that supports garbage collection. It is an excellent choice for developing server-side applications and is widely used for web development. Go also has a rich library of packages, which makes it easy to connect to databases and perform various operations.

One of the most popular database systems is PostgreSQL, and Go provides a driver package, **`github.com/lib/pq`**, that allows developers to interact with a PostgreSQL database easily. In this article, we will cover how to perform CRUD operations using the **`pq`** package in Go.

## **Prerequisites**

- Go language installed and setup
- PostgreSQL database installed and running
- Go module enabled (optional)

## **Setup**

To start using the **`pq`** package, you need to install it by running the following command:

```go
go get github.com/lib/pq
```

## **Connect to the Database**

The first step in connecting to a PostgreSQL database is to import the **`pq`** package and create a new connection using the **`sql.Open()`** function. The **`sql.Open()`** function takes two arguments: the name of the driver and a connection string that includes all the necessary information to connect to the database. The connection string has the following format:

```bash
user=user password=password host=host port=port dbname=dbname sslmode=mode
```

Here is an example of how to create a connection to the database:

```go
package main

import (
	"database/sql"
	"fmt"
	_ "github.com/lib/pq"
)

func main() {
	connStr := "user=postgres password=postgres host=localhost port=5432 dbname=postgres sslmode=disable"
	db, err := sql.Open("postgres", connStr)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	defer db.Close()
}
```

## **CRUD Operations**

### **Create**

To create a new record in the database, you need to use the **`Exec`** method of the **`sql.DB`** object. The **`Exec`** method takes a SQL query as an argument and returns a **`Result`** object that contains information about the executed query.

Here is an example of how to create a new record:

```go
query := `INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'johndoe@example.com')`
result, err := db.Exec(query)
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println(err)
	return
}
id, err := result.LastInsertId()
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println(err)
	return
}
fmt.Println("Inserted record with ID:", id)
```

### **Read**

To retrieve data from the database, you need to use the **`Query`** method of the **`sql.DB`** object. The **`Query`** method takes a SQL query as an argument and returns a **`Rows`** object that contains the result of the query.

Here is an example of how to retrieve data from the database:

```go
query := `SELECT id, name, email FROM users`
rows, err := db.Query(query)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
    return
}
defer rows.Close()

for rows.Next() {
    var id int
    var name, email string
    if err := rows.Scan(&id, &name, &email); err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        return
    }
    fmt.Println("ID:", id, "Name:", name, "Email:", email)
}

if err := rows.Err(); err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
    return
}
```

### Update

To update an existing record in the database, you need to use the `Exec` method, similar to creating a record. The only difference is the SQL query, which should update the existing record.

Here is an example of how to update an existing record:

```go
query := **UPDATE users SET name='Jane Doe' WHERE id=1**
result, err := db.Exec(query)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
    return
}
rowsAffected, err := result.RowsAffected()
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
    return
}
fmt.Println("Number of rows affected:", rowsAffected)
```

### Delete

To delete a record from the database, you need to use the `Exec` method, similar to updating a record. The only difference is the SQL query, which should delete the record.

Here is an example of how to delete a record:

```go
query := **DELETE FROM users WHERE id=1**
result, err := db.Exec(query)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
    return
}
rowsAffected, err := result.RowsAffected()
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
    return
}
fmt.Println("Number of rows affected:", rowsAffected)
```

### Conclusion

In this article, we have covered how to perform CRUD operations using the `pq` package in Go language. The `pq` package is easy to use and provides a simple way to interact with a PostgreSQL database. Go language, with its rich library of packages, makes it easy to develop server-side applications and connect to databases.
