# **Crud Operations with CockroachDB Driver Package in Golang**

CockroachDB is a cloud-native SQL database that provides strong consistency, survivability, and horizontal scalability. CockroachDB has its own Go Driver Package, which makes it easy to interact with a CockroachDB database in Golang. In this guide, we will cover the basics of performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with the CockroachDB driver package in Golang.

## **Prerequisites**

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- Go installed on your machine
- CockroachDB installed and running on your machine or on a remote server
- A database created in CockroachDB

## **Connecting to CockroachDB**

The first step to perform CRUD operations with CockroachDB in Golang is to establish a connection to the database. To connect to CockroachDB, we use the **`lib/pq`** package, which is a pure Go implementation of the PostgreSQL protocol.

```go
package main

import (
	"database/sql"
	"fmt"

	_ "github.com/lib/pq"
)

func main() {
	connStr := "postgresql://root@localhost:26257/mydb?sslmode=disable"
	db, err := sql.Open("postgres", connStr)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error opening connection to CockroachDB:", err)
		return
	}
	defer db.Close()
}
```

In the code above, we import the **`database/sql`** and **`fmt`** packages and the **`lib/pq`** package, which is the CockroachDB driver package for Go. Then we create a connection string **`connStr`** with the necessary information to connect to our CockroachDB database.

Next, we call the **`sql.Open`** function and pass in the driver name **`"postgres"`** and the connection string **`connStr`**. The function returns a **`*sql.DB`** value, which is a database handle, and an error value. If the connection was successful, we can now use the database handle **`db`** to perform CRUD operations on the CockroachDB database.

## **CRUD Operations**

### **Creating Data**

To insert data into a CockroachDB database, we use the **`Exec`** method of the database handle. The **`Exec`** method takes a SQL query as a parameter and returns a **`Result`** value, which contains information about the query execution.

```go
res, err := db.Exec("INSERT INTO blog (title, content) VALUES ($1, $2)", "My First Blog", "Hello World!")
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println("Error executing INSERT query:", err)
	return
}
```

In the code above, we call the **`Exec`** method on the database handle **`db`** and pass in a SQL query to insert a new record into the **`blog`** table. The query uses placeholders **`$1`** and **`$2`** to avoid SQL injection and to make it easier to reuse the same query with different values.

### **Reading Data**

To read data from a CockroachDB database, we use the **`Query`** method of the database handle. The **`Query`** method takes a SQL query as a parameter and returns a **`*Rows`** value, which is a cursor over the query result set.

To retrieve the data from the \*Rows value, we use a loop and the Scan method to extract the values from each row. The Scan method takes pointers to variables as parameters and assigns the values from the current row to the variables.

```go
rows, err := db.Query("SELECT id, title, content FROM blog")
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println("Error executing SELECT query:", err)
	return
}
defer rows.Close()
for rows.Next() {
	var id int
	var title, content string
	if err := rows.Scan(&id, &title, &content); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error scanning result:", err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Println("ID:", id, "Title:", title, "Content:", content)
}
```

### Updating Data

To update data in a CockroachDB database, we use the Exec method of the database handle and a SQL query with the UPDATE statement. The Exec method returns a Result value with information about the query execution.

```go
res, err := db.Exec("UPDATE blog SET title=$1, content=$2 WHERE id=$3", "My Updated Blog", "Hello, updated World!", 1)
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println("Error executing UPDATE query:", err)
	return
}
```

### Deleting Data

To delete data from a CockroachDB database, we use the Exec method of the database handle and a SQL query with the DELETE statement. The Exec method returns a Result value with information about the query execution.

```go
res, err := db.Exec("DELETE FROM blog WHERE id=$1", 1)
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println("Error executing DELETE query:", err)
	return
}
```

### Conclusion

In this guide, we covered the basics of performing CRUD operations with the CockroachDB driver package in Golang. We discussed how to connect to a CockroachDB database, how to insert, retrieve, update, and delete data from the database. With this information, you can now start building real-world applications with CockroachDB and Golang.
