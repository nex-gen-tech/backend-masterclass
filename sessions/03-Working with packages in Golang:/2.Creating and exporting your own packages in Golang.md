# Creating and exporting your own packages in Golang

In Golang, a package is a collection of related Go source files that are grouped together to provide additional functionality. You can create your own packages in Golang to organize and reuse your code, and you can export the functions and types in your packages to make them available to other packages and programs.

To create a package in Golang, you simply need to create a directory with the package name, and then put the Go source files for the package in that directory. For example, to create a package named **`todo`**, you would create a **`todo`** directory and put the Go source files for the package in that directory.

Once you have created the package directory and added the Go source files, you can use the **`package`** keyword at the top of each source file to specify the package name. For example, if you have a file named **`todo.go`** in the **`todo`** package, you would use the following syntax at the top of the file:

```go
package todo
```

After you have specified the package name, you can define the functions and types that you want to export from the package. To export a function or type, you simply need to capitalize the first letter of its name. For example, if you have a **`TodoItem`** type and a **`GetTodoItems`** function in the **`todo`** package, you would use the following syntax to define them:

```go

// TodoItem is a struct that represents a todo item.
type TodoItem struct {
  ID int
  Title string
  Content string
}

// GetTodoItems returns a slice of todo items.
func GetTodoItems() []TodoItem {
  // return slice of todo items
}
```

In this example, the **`TodoItem`** type and the **`GetTodoItems`** function are exported from the package because their names are capitalized. This means that they can be accessed by other packages and programs that import the **`todo`** package.

To import and use the **`todo`** package in another program, you would use the **`import`** keyword followed by the package name. For example, to import the **`todo`** package and use the **`GetTodoItems`** function, you would use the following syntax:

```go
import "todo"

func main() {
  // get todo items
  items := todo.GetTodoItems()

  // use todo items
}
```

In this example, the **`todo`** package is imported and the **`GetTodoItems`** function is called to get the todo items. The todo items are then used in the main function of the program.

Overall, creating and exporting your own packages in Golang is a simple and straightforward process. You create a directory with the package name and add the Go source files for the package, and then you use the **`package`** keyword to specify the package name and the **`import`** keyword to import the package in another program. This allows you to organize and reuse your code, and make it available to other packages and programs.
