# Importing and using external packages in Golang

In Golang, external packages are third-party libraries that provide additional functionality that is not included in the standard library. To use an external package in your Go code, you first need to import it into your project.

To import an external package, you use the **`import`** keyword followed by the package name. For example, to import the **`net/http`** package, you would use the following syntax:

```go
import "net/http"
```

You can also use the **`import`** keyword to give the package a different name, which can be useful if the package name conflicts with another name in your code. For example, to import the **`net/http`** package and give it the name **`http2`**, you would use the following syntax:

```go
import http2 "net/http"
```

After importing an external package, you can use the functions and types provided by the package in your code. To do this, you use the package name followed by the name of the function or type. For example, to use the **`ListenAndServe`** function from the **`net/http`** package, you would use the following syntax:

```go
http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
```

Or, if you gave the package a different name when importing it, you would use that name instead of the original package name. For example, if you imported the **`net/http`** package as **`http2`**, you would use the following syntax to call the **`ListenAndServe`** function:

```go
http2.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
```

In addition to importing external packages, you can also import multiple packages at the same time using the **`import`** keyword. To do this, you separate the package names with a comma. For example, to import the **`net/http`** and **`github.com/gorilla/mux`** packages, you would use the following syntax:

```go
import (
  "net/http"
  "github.com/gorilla/mux"
)
```

Overall, importing and using external packages in Golang is a simple and straightforward process. You use the **`import`** keyword to bring the package into your project, and then you can use the functions and types provided by the package in your code. This allows you to extend the functionality of your Go programs and take advantage of the many useful libraries that are available in the Go ecosystem.
