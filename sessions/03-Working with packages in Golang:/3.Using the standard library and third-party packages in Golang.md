# Using the standard library and third-party packages in Golang

In Golang, the standard library is a collection of packages that are included with the Go installation, and provides a wide range of functionality that is essential for building Go applications. These packages include everything from basic data types and algorithms, to networking and web programming, to concurrency and parallelism.

To use a package from the standard library in your Go code, you simply need to import it using the **`import`** keyword. For example, to import the **`fmt`** package, which provides formatting and printing functions, you would use the following syntax:

```go

import "fmt"
```

After importing the package, you can use the functions and types provided by the package in your code. For example, to use the **`Println`** function from the **`fmt`** package to print a message to the console, you would use the following syntax:

```
fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
```

In addition to the standard library, there are also many third-party packages that provide additional functionality that is not included in the standard library. These packages are created and maintained by the Go community, and they can be found on popular package repositories such as GitHub and GitLab, or on the Go module registry.

To use a third-party package in your Go code, you first need to install it using the **`go get`** command. For example, to install the **`github.com/gorilla/mux`** package, which provides a powerful HTTP router and request dispatcher, you would use the following command:

```go
go get github.com/gorilla/mux
```

After the package has been installed, you can import it into your code using the **`import`** keyword. For example, to import the **`github.com/gorilla/mux`** package, you would use the following syntax:

```go
import "github.com/gorilla/mux"
```

After importing the package, you can use the functions and types provided by the package in your code. For example, to create a new router using the **`NewRouter`** function from the **`github.com/gorilla/mux`** package, you would use the following syntax:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
```

Overall, using the standard library and third-party packages in Golang is a simple and straightforward process. You use the **`import`** keyword to bring the packages into your code, and then you can use the functions and types provided by the packages in your code. This allows you to extend the functionality of your Go programs and take advantage of the many useful libraries that are available in the Go ecosystem.
