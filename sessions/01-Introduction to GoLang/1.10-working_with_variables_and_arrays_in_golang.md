# Working with variables and arrays in Golang

In Golang, variables are containers for storing and manipulating data. Variables are declared using the "var" keyword, followed by the variable name, type, and initial value. Golang also has arrays, which are fixed-length, homogeneous collections of values. Arrays are declared using the "var" keyword and the square bracket notation, followed by the array type and length.

Some examples of declaring and using variables and arrays in Golang are:

```go
// Declare and initialize a variable
var i int = 1

// Declare an array with 3 elements
var a [3]int = [3]int{1, 2, 3}

// Declare and initialize a variable using short declaration syntax
j := 2

// Declare and initialize an array using short declaration syntax
b := [3]int{1, 2, 3}
```

To access and manipulate the values in variables and arrays, developers can use the "=" operator to assign values, the index notation to access elements, and the "len" built-in function to get the length of an array.

```go
// Assign a value to a variable
i = 10

// Access an element in an array
x := a[0]

// Assign a value to an element in an array
a[1] = 20

// Get the length of an array
n := len(a)
```

In addition to arrays, Golang also has slices, which are dynamic, heterogeneous collections of values. Slices are declared using the "var" keyword and the square bracket notation, but without specifying the length. Slices can be created from arrays and other slices, and they can be manipulated using a rich set of built-in functions and methods.

```go
// Declare and initialize a slice
s := []int{1, 2, 3}

// Create a slice from an array
t := a[:]
```
