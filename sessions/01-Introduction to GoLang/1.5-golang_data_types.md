## Difference between Primitive and Non-primitive Data Types

In programming, a primitive data type is a basic type that is built into the language and represents a single value. Examples of primitive data types include integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, and characters.

A non-primitive data type, also known as a composite data type, is a data type that is derived from one or more primitive data types and represents a more complex structure. Examples of non-primitive data types include arrays, strings, and objects.

The distinction between primitive and non-primitive data types can vary depending on the programming language. Some languages may consider certain data types, such as strings, to be primitive, while other languages may consider them to be non-primitive. In general, however, primitive data types are the most basic building blocks of a program and are usually implemented directly by the language or runtime, while non-primitive data types are constructed from primitive data types and offer more complex behavior.

Here are some key differences between primitive and non-primitive data types:

- Primitive data types are simple and represent a single value, while non-primitive data types are more complex and can represent multiple values.
- Primitive data types are usually implemented directly by the language or runtime, while non-primitive data types are constructed from primitive data types.
- Primitive data types are usually passed by value, while non-primitive data types are usually passed by reference. This means that when a primitive data type is passed as an argument to a function, a copy of the value is passed, while when a non-primitive data type is passed, a reference to the object is passed.

## Primitive Data Types

1. Numeric types: int, int8, int16, int32, int64, uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, float32, float64
2. Boolean type: bool
3. String type: string

These data types are considered primitive because they represent a single value and do not have any additional behavior beyond what is defined by the language.

Here are some examples of using these primitive data types in Go:

```go
// Declare and initialize a variable of type int
var x int = 10

// Declare and initialize a variable of type float64
var y float64 = 3.14

// Declare and initialize a variable of type bool
var z bool = true

// Declare and initialize a variable of type string
var s string = "Hello, World!"
```

## Non-primitive data types

1. Pointer types: \*T, \*\*T
2. Slice type: []T
3. Map type: map[K]V
4. Struct type: struct
5. Interface type: interface
6. Function type: func(T1, T2, ...) R

These data types are considered non-primitive because they are constructed from primitive data types and offer more complex behavior.

Here are some examples of using non-primitive data types in Go:

```go
// Declare a slice of integers
var x []int

// Initialize a map of strings to integers
var y map[string]int = make(map[string]int)

// Define a struct type
type Person struct {
  Name string
  Age int
}

// Declare and initialize a variable of type Person
var z Person = Person{Name: "Alice", Age: 25}

// Declare a function that takes two integers and returns their sum
func sum(x int, y int) int {
  return x + y
}
```
