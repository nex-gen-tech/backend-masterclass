# Control flows and loops in Golang

Golang provides several control flow statements and loops for executing code conditionally and iteratively. Some of the key control flows and loops in Golang are:

- If and else statements: Golang has "if" and "else" statements for executing code conditionally. The "if" statement allows developers to specify a condition, and the code inside the "if" block will be executed only if the condition is true. The "else" statement allows developers to specify a block of code that will be executed if the condition in the "if" statement is false. For example:

```go
if x > 10 {
    // do something
} else if x == 10 {
    // do something else
} else {
    // do something else
}
```

- For and range loops: Golang has "for" and "range" loops for iterating over collections of values. The "for" loop allows developers to specify a loop condition and an iteration expression, and the code inside the loop will be executed repeatedly until the condition is false. The "range" loop allows developers to iterate over arrays, slices, strings, maps, and other collections, and it automatically extracts the index and value of each element in the collection. For example:

```go
// For loop
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    // do something
}

// Range loop
arr := []int{1, 2, 3}
for i, v := range arr {
    // do something with index i and value v
}
```

- Switch and case statements: Golang has "switch" and "case" statements for executing code based on multiple cases. The "switch" statement allows developers to specify a value and a series of "case" statements, and the code inside the matching "case" block will be executed. The "case" statement allows developers to specify a value or a range of values, and the code inside the "case" block will be executed only if the value in the "switch" statement matches the value in the "case" statement. For example:

```go
switch x {
case 1:
    // do something
case 2, 3:
    // do something else
default:
    // do something else
}
```

- Break and continue statements: Golang has "break" and "continue" statements for controlling the flow of loops. The "break" statement allows developers to immediately exit a loop, and the "continue" statement allows developers to skip the

Iteration of a loop and continue with the next iteration. For example:

```go
// Break
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    if i == 5 {
        break
    }
    // do something
}

// Continue
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    if i % 2 == 0 {
        continue
    }
    // do something
}
```
