# Different ways of using for loop

In Go, the **`for`** loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code. There are three forms of the **`for`** loop in Go:

1. The **`for`** loop with a single condition:

```go
for condition {
    // code block to be executed
}
```

This form of the **`for`** loop will continue to execute the code block as long as the condition is **`true`**.

1. The **`for`** loop with a pre-test and post-test:

```go
for initialization; condition; post {
    // code block to be executed
}
```

This form of the **`for`** loop initializes a variable before the loop starts, and then tests the condition before each iteration of the loop. The code block will be executed as long as the condition is **`true`**. The post statement is executed after each iteration of the loop.

1. The **`for`** loop with a range:

```go
for index, element := range collection {
    // code block to be executed
}
```

This form of the **`for`** loop iterates over the elements of a collection, such as an array or slice. The loop variable **`index`** is the index of the current element, and **`element`** is the value of the current element. The loop will continue until all elements of the collection have been processed.

Here is an example of using each of these forms of the **`for`** loop:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // for loop with a single condition
    i := 1
    for i <= 10 {
        fmt.Println(i)
        i++
    }

    // for loop with a pre-test and post-test
    for j := 1; j <= 10; j++ {
        fmt.Println(j)
    }

    // for loop with a range
    numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    for k, num := range numbers {
        fmt.Println(k, num)
    }
}
```

This code will output the numbers 1 through 10, followed by the numbers 1 through 10 again, followed by the index and value of each element in the **`numbers`** slice.
