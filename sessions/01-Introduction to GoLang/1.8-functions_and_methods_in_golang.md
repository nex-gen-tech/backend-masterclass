# Functions and methods in Golang

Golang has a powerful and flexible function and method system that allows developers to define and call functions and methods easily. Some of the key features and characteristics of functions and methods in Golang are:

- Function declarations: In Golang, functions are declared using the "func" keyword, followed by the function name, arguments, and return type. Functions can take zero or more arguments, and they can return zero or more values. For example:

```go
func add(x int, y int) int {
    return x + y
}

func greet() {
    fmt.Println("Hello")
}
```

- Multiple return values: In Golang, functions can return multiple values. This is useful for returning multiple results or for returning an error and a result. The multiple return values are specified in the function signature, and they are returned using the "return" statement. For example:

```go
func div(x int, y int) (int, error) {
    if y == 0 {
        return 0, errors.New("divide by zero")
    }
    return x / y, nil
}
```

- Anonymous functions: In Golang, anonymous functions are functions that are not bound to a name. Anonymous functions are useful for creating and calling functions inline, without the need to declare them separately. Anonymous functions are declared using the "func" keyword and can be called immediately after their declaration. For example:

```go
func(x int, y int) int {
    return x + y
}(1, 2) // returns 3
```

- Variadic functions: In Golang, variadic functions are functions that can take a variable number of arguments. Variadic functions are declared using the "..." syntax in the function signature, and they can be called with any number of arguments. The variadic arguments are passed as a slice, and they can be accessed and manipulated like any other slice. For example:

```go
func sum(nums ...int) int {
    var total int
    for _, n := range nums {
        total += n
    }
    return total
}

sum(1, 2, 3) // returns 6
```

- Method declarations: In Golang, methods are functions that are associated with a struct type. Methods can be declared by defining a function with a receiver argument that is of the struct type. Methods can be called on instances of the struct type, and they can access and modify the receiver's fields and properties. For example:

```go
type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age int
}

func (p Person) String() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("%s is %d years old", p.Name, p.Age)
}

var p Person = Person{Name: "John", Age: 30}
fmt.Println(p.String()) // prints "John is 30 years old"

```
