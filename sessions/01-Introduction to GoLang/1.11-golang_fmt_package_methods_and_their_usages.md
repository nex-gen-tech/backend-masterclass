# Golang fmt package methods and their usages

The **`fmt`** package in Go provides a variety of methods for formatting and printing strings, integers, and other values. Some common methods in the **`fmt`** package are:

- **`Println(a ...interface{})`**: This method prints one or more values to the standard output, followed by a newline character. This method is useful for printing simple messages or for printing values separated by spaces.
- **`Printf(format string, a ...interface{})`**: This method prints a formatted string to the standard output. The **`format`** parameter specifies the format of the output string, using placeholder symbols such as **`%d`** for integers and **`%f`** for floating-point numbers. The **`a`** parameter is a slice of values that will be formatted and inserted into the output string.
- **`Sprintln(a ...interface{}) string`**: This method formats and returns a string, similar to **`Println()`**, but it does not print the string to the standard output. Instead, it returns the formatted string, which can be stored in a variable or used in other ways.
- **`Sprintf(format string, a ...interface{}) string`**: This method formats and returns a string, similar to **`Printf()`**, but it does not print the string to the standard output. Instead, it returns the formatted string, which can be stored in a variable or used in other ways.

These and other methods in the **`fmt`** package can be useful for formatting and printing values in Go programs. By using these methods, you can write Go programs that are easy to read, debug, and maintain.

## Examples -

Here is an example that demonstrates how to use the **`Println()`** method of the **`fmt`** package to print a message to the standard output:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	name := "John Doe"
	fmt.Println("Hello, my name is", name)
}
```

In this example, the **`fmt.Println()`** method is used to print a message to the standard output. The **`Println()`** method takes one or more values as arguments and prints them to the standard output, separated by spaces and followed by a newline character.

Using the **`Println()`** method of the **`fmt`** package is a best practice in Go, because it provides a simple and efficient way to print messages to the standard output. The **`Println()`** method is one of the most commonly used methods in the **`fmt`** package, and it is a valuable tool for writing Go programs that produce output.

Here is an example that demonstrates how to use the **`Printf()`** method of the **`fmt`** package to print a formatted string to the standard output:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	name := "John Doe"
	age := 33
	height := 1.85

	fmt.Printf("Hello, my name is %s, and I am %d years old\n", name, age)
	fmt.Printf("I am %.2f meters tall\n", height)
}
```

In this example, the **`fmt.Printf()`** method is used to print two formatted strings to the standard output. The **`Printf()`** method takes a format string as its first argument, followed by a slice of values that will be formatted and inserted into the output string. The format string uses placeholder symbols such as **`%s`** for strings, **`%d`** for integers, and **`%f`** for floating-point numbers.

Using the **`Printf()`** method of the **`fmt`** package is a best practice in Go, because it provides a powerful and flexible way to format and print values to the standard output. The **`Printf()`** method is one of the most commonly used methods in the **`fmt`** package, and it is a valuable tool for writing Go programs that produce output.

Here is an example that demonstrates how to use the **`Sprintln()`** method of the **`fmt`** package to format and return a string:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	name := "John Doe"
	age := 33
	height := 1.85

	s1 := fmt.Sprintln("Hello, my name is", name)
	s2 := fmt.Sprintf("I am %d years old, and I am %.2f meters tall", age, height)

	fmt.Println(s1)
	fmt.Println(s2)
}
```

In this example, the **`fmt.Sprintln()`** and **`fmt.Sprintf()`** methods are used to format and return strings. The **`Sprintln()`** and **`Sprintf()`** methods are similar to the **`Println()`** and **`Printf()`** methods, respectively, but they do not print the formatted strings to the standard output. Instead, they return the formatted strings, which can be stored in variables and used in other ways.

Using the **`Sprintln()`** and **`Sprintf()`** methods of the **`fmt`** package is a best practice in Go, because they provide a convenient and efficient way to format and return strings without printing them to the standard output. The **`Sprintln()`** and **`Sprintf()`** methods are useful for storing formatted strings in variables, passing them to other functions, or using them in other ways.

Here is an example that demonstrates how to use the **`Fprintln()`** method of the **`fmt`** package to print a message to a file:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	name := "John Doe"

	file, err := os.Create("hello.txt")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error creating file:", err)
		return
	}
	defer file.Close()

	fmt.Fprintln(file, "Hello, my name is", name)
}
```

In this example, the **`fmt.Fprintln()`** method is used to print a message to a file. The **`Fprintln()`** method is similar to the **`Println()`** method, but it takes a **`io.Writer`** interface as its first argument, instead of printing to the standard output. This allows the **`Fprintln()`** method to write to any type of output stream, including files, network connections, and other types of streams.

Using the **`Fprintln()`** method of the **`fmt`** package is a best practice in Go, because it provides a simple and efficient way to print messages to files or other types of output streams. The **`Fprintln()`** method is one of the many methods in the **`fmt`** package that provide a flexible and powerful way to format and print values in Go programs.
