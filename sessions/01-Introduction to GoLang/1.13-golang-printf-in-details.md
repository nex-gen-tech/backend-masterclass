# Golang `fmt.Printf` in Details

The **`fmt.Printf`** function in Go allows you to print formatted strings to the console. You can use various format specifiers to specify the type of the value that you want to print. Here are some of the most common format specifiers:

- **`%v`**: prints the value in a default format
- **`%T`**: prints the type of the value
- **`%t`**: prints a boolean value as **`true`** or **`false`**
- **`%d`**: prints an integer in decimal format
- **`%b`**: prints an integer in binary format
- **`%o`**: prints an integer in octal format
- **`%x`**: prints an integer in hexadecimal format
- **`%f`**: prints a floating-point number
- **`%e`**: prints a floating-point number in scientific notation
- **`%E`**: prints a floating-point number in scientific notation with an uppercase **`E`**
- **`%s`**: prints a string
- **`%q`**: prints a quoted string
- **`%p`**: prints a pointer

Here is an example of using some of these format specifiers:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    i := 42
    f := 3.14
    s := "Hello, world!"
    b := true
    p := &i

    fmt.Printf("i is of type %T and has value %v\n", i, i)
    fmt.Printf("f is of type %T and has value %f\n", f, f)
    fmt.Printf("s is of type %T and has value %s\n", s, s)
    fmt.Printf("b is of type %T and has value %t\n", b, b)
    fmt.Printf("p is of type %T and has value %p\n", p, p)
}
```

This code will output the following:

```bash
i is of type int and has value 42
f is of type float64 and has value 3.140000
s is of type string and has value Hello, world!
b is of type bool and has value true
p is of type *int and has value 0x40e020

```
