# Golang `new` and `make` keywords and their differences

In Go, the **`new`** and **`make`** keywords are used to allocate memory for different types of variables.

The **`new`** keyword is used to allocate memory for a given type and return a pointer to it. It can be used with any type, including built-in types, user-defined types, and pointers.

Here is an example of how to use the **`new`** keyword:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// Allocate memory for an int and return a pointer to it
	ptr1 := new(int)
	*ptr1 = 123

	// Allocate memory for a string and return a pointer to it
	ptr2 := new(string)
	*ptr2 = "hello"

	// Allocate memory for a struct and return a pointer to it
	type Point struct {
		X int
		Y int
	}
	ptr3 := new(Point)
	(*ptr3).X = 10
	(*ptr3).Y = 20

	fmt.Println(*ptr1) // Prints 123
	fmt.Println(*ptr2) // Prints "hello"
	fmt.Println(*ptr3) // Prints {10 20}
}
```

In this example, the **`new`** keyword is used to allocate memory for an **`int`**, a **`string`**, and a **`Point`** struct, and return pointers to them. The values of the variables are then accessed and modified using the pointers.

The **`make`** keyword is used to create and initialize slices, maps, and channels. It takes a type and an optional capacity as arguments and returns a value of the type initialized with the given capacity.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// Create a slice of ints with a capacity of 5 and a length of 3
	slice1 := make([]int, 3, 5)
	slice1[0] = 1
	slice1[1] = 2
	slice1[2] = 3

	// Create a map of strings to ints
	map1 := make(map[string]int)
	map1["one"] = 1
	map1["two"] = 2
	map1["three"] = 3

	// Create a channel of strings
	channel1 := make(chan string)
	channel1 <- "hello"
	channel1 <- "world"

	fmt.Println(slice1)       // Prints [1 2 3]
	fmt.Println(map1)         // Prints map[one:1 three:3 two:2]
	fmt.Println(<-channel1)   // Prints "hello"
	fmt.Println(<-channel1)   // Prints "world"
}
```

In this example, the **`make`** keyword is used to create a slice of ints with a capacity of 5 and a length of 3, a map of strings to ints, and a channel of strings. The values of the slice and map are then modified using the index and key operators, and the channel is used to send and receive values.

## Some differences between `new` and `make`

Here are some key differences between the **`new`** and **`make`** keywords in Go:

- The **`new`** keyword is used to allocate memory for a given type and return a pointer to it, while the **`make`** keyword is used to create and initialize slices, maps, and channels.
- The **`new`** keyword can be used with any type, including built-in types, user-defined types, and pointers, while the **`make`** keyword can only be used with slices, maps, and channels.
- The **`new`** keyword takes a type as an argument and returns a pointer to a value of that type initialized to zero, while the **`make`** keyword takes a type and an optional capacity as arguments and returns a value of the type initialized with the given capacity.
- The **`new`** keyword does not initialize the memory it allocates, while the **`make`** keyword initializes the memory it allocates and sets up any necessary internal structures for the type.
- The **`new`** keyword is slower than the **`make`** keyword because it has to zero out the memory it allocates, while the **`make`** keyword does not have to do this.
