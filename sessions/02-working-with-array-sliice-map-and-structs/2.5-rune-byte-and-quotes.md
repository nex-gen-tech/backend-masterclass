# Rune Datatype in Golang

A **`rune`** in Go is a type that represents a single Unicode code point. It is an alias for the **`int32`** type, so a **`rune`** value is a 32-bit integer representing a Unicode code point.

Here is an example of how to declare a variable of type **`rune`** and assign it a value:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var ch rune = 'A' // Declare a variable of type rune and assign it the value of the Unicode code point for the letter 'A'
	fmt.Println(ch)   // Prints 65, the decimal representation of the Unicode code point for 'A'
}
```

You can also use the **`rune`** type to represent special characters, such as newline, tab, or space:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var ch1 rune = '\n' // Declare a variable of type rune and assign it the value of the Unicode code point for a newline character
	var ch2 rune = '\t' // Declare a variable of type rune and assign it the value of the Unicode code point for a tab character
	var ch3 rune = ' '  // Declare a variable of type rune and assign it the value of the Unicode code point for a space character
	fmt.Println(ch1, ch2, ch3) // Prints 10 9 32, the decimal representations of the Unicode code points for newline, tab, and space
}
```

You can also use the **`rune`** type to represent emoji characters:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var ch1 rune = 'ðŸ˜€' // Declare a variable of type rune and assign it the value of the Unicode code point for the grinning face emoji
	var ch2 rune = 'ðŸš€' // Declare a variable of type rune and assign it the value of the Unicode code point for the rocket emoji
	var ch3 rune = 'ðŸŽ‰' // Declare a variable of type rune and assign it the value of the Unicode code point for the party popper emoji
	fmt.Println(ch1, ch2, ch3) // Prints 128512 128640 127881, the decimal representations of the Unicode code points for the grinning face, rocket, and party popper emojis
}
```

You can use the **`fmt.Printf`** function with the **`%c`** format verb to print a **`rune`** value as a character:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var ch1 rune = 'A'
	var ch2 rune = 'ðŸ˜€'
	var ch3 rune = 'ðŸš€'
	var ch4 rune = 'ðŸŽ‰'
	fmt.Printf("%c %c %c %c\n", ch1, ch2, ch3, ch4) // Prints A ðŸ˜€ ðŸš€ ðŸŽ‰
}
```

In this example, the **`fmt.Printf`** function is used to print the **`rune`** values as characters using the **`%c`** format verb.

You can also use the **`string(rune)`** conversion to convert a **`rune`** value to a **`string`**:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var ch1 rune = 'A'
	var ch2 rune = 'ðŸ˜€'
	var ch3 rune = 'ðŸš€'
	var ch4 rune = 'ðŸŽ‰'
	fmt.Println(string(ch1), string(ch2), string(ch3), string(ch4)) // Prints A ðŸ˜€ ðŸš€ ðŸŽ‰
}
```

In this example, the **`string`** function is used to convert each **`rune`** value to a **`string`**, and the resulting strings are printed using the **`fmt.Println`** function.

## Difference between **`rune`** and **`byte`**

In Go, a **`rune`** is a type that represents a single Unicode code point, while a **`byte`** is a type that represents a single byte.

The **`rune`** type is an alias for the **`int32`** type, so a **`rune`** value is a 32-bit integer representing a Unicode code point. The **`byte`** type is an alias for the **`uint8`** type, so a **`byte`** value is an 8-bit unsigned integer.

One difference between **`rune`** and **`byte`** is that **`rune`** is used to represent character data, while **`byte`** is used to represent binary data. In Go, string values are made up of a sequence of **`rune`** values, while slices of type **`[]byte`** are used to represent binary data.

Here is an example of how to declare variables of type **`rune`** and **`byte`** and assign them values:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var ch1 rune = 'A'
	var b1 byte = 'B'
	fmt.Println(ch1, b1) // Prints 65 66

	// Convert a rune to a string
	str1 := string(ch1)
	fmt.Println(str1) // Prints A

	// Convert a byte to a string
	str2 := string(b1)
	fmt.Println(str2) // Prints B

	// Convert a string to a slice of runes
	runes1 := []rune("hello")
	fmt.Println(runes1) // Prints [104 101 108 108 111]

	// Convert a string to a slice of bytes
	bytes1 := []byte("world")
	fmt.Println(bytes1) // Prints [119 111 114 108 100]
}
```

In this example, the **`string`** function is used to convert a **`rune`** value and a **`byte`** value to strings, and the **`[]rune`** and **`[]byte`** types are used to convert a string to a slice of runes and a slice of bytes, respectively.

## Difference between Single Quotes and Double Quotes in Golang

In Go, single quotes are used to represent rune literals, while double quotes are used to represent string literals.

A rune literal is a single Unicode code point written as a character surrounded by single quotes. For example, 'a' is a rune literal representing the letter "a". Rune literals are represented by the **`rune`** type in Go, which is an alias for the **`int32`** type.

Here is an example of how to use a rune literal:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var ch1 rune = 'a' // Declare a variable of type rune and assign it the value of the Unicode code point for the letter 'a'
	fmt.Println(ch1)   // Prints 97, the decimal representation of the Unicode code point for 'a'
}
```

A string literal is a sequence of characters surrounded by double quotes. For example, "hello" is a string literal representing the string "hello". String literals are represented by the **`string`** type in Go.

Here is an example of how to use a string literal:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var str1 string = "hello" // Declare a variable of type string and assign it the value "hello"
	fmt.Println(str1)        // Prints "hello"
}
```

One difference between rune literals and string literals is that rune literals can only contain a single Unicode code point, while string literals can contain any sequence of characters. For example, 'a' is a valid rune literal, but 'abc' is not, because it contains more than one character. On the other hand, "abc" is a valid string literal.

Another difference is that escape sequences, such as **`\n`** for a newline character, can be used in string literals, but not in rune literals. For example, "hello\nworld" is a valid string literal, but 'hello\nworld' is not a valid rune literal.

In general, it is recommended to use string literals unless you have a specific reason to use rune literals, such as working with individual Unicode code points.
