# **Real-World Usages of the `init` Function in Go**

The **`init`** function in Go is a special function that is automatically called before the main function starts. It is used to initialize variables, set up connections, and perform other tasks that need to be done before the program starts running.

## **Use Case 1: Initializing Global Variables**

One common use of the **`init`** function is to initialize global variables. For example, a program that uses a database connection might use the **`init`** function to establish the connection before the main function starts running.

```go
var db *sql.DB

func init() {
    var err error
    db, err = sql.Open("postgres", "user=postgres password=mypassword dbname=mydb sslmode=disable")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}
```

In this example, the **`init`** function establishes a connection to a PostgreSQL database using the **`sql.Open`** function. If an error occurs, the program will log the error and exit.

## **Use Case 2: Registering Functions**

Another use of the **`init`** function is to register functions that need to be called at a specific point in the program's execution. For example, a program that uses the **`flag`** package might use the **`init`** function to register flags that can be passed to the program on the command line.

```go
func init() {
    flag.String("config", "config.json", "path to config file")
}
```

In this example, the **`init`** function registers a flag named **`config`** with the default value of **`config.json`**. When the program starts, the user can pass a different value for the **`config`** flag on the command line to change the path to the config file.

## **Use Case 3: Initializing Third-Party Libraries**

The **`init`** function can also be used to initialize third-party libraries that need to be set up before the main function starts running. For example, a program that uses the **`gorm`** library to interact with a database might use the **`init`** function to connect to the database and perform any necessary migrations.

```go
func init() {
    var err error
    db, err = gorm.Open("sqlite3", "test.db")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    db.AutoMigrate(&User{})
}
```

In this example, the **`init`** function connects to a SQLite3 database and automatically migrates the **`User`** struct.

## **Conclusion**

The **`init`** function in Go is a powerful tool that allows you to perform tasks before the main function starts running. Whether you're initializing global variables, registering functions, or setting up third-party libraries, the **`init`** function can help you get your program up and running quickly and smoothly.
