# Working with Maps

In Go, a map is a collection of key-value pairs that are stored in a hash table. To create a map, you can use the built-in **`make`** function:

```go
m := make(map[string]int)
```

This creates a map with string keys and int values. You can also use the short declaration syntax to create a map:

```go
m := map[string]int{}
```

To add a key-value pair to the map, you can use the **`[key] = value`** syntax:

```go
m["key"] = 10
```

To retrieve a value from the map, you can use the **`[key]`** syntax:

```go
value := m["key"]
```

If the key does not exist in the map, the value will be the zero value of the value type (**`0`** for integers). To check if a key exists in the map, you can use the **`, ok := m[key]`** syntax:

```go
value, ok := m["key"]
if !ok {
    fmt.Println("Key does not exist")
}
```

To iterate over the key-value pairs in a map, you can use a range loop:

```go
for key, value := range m {
    fmt.Println(key, value)
}
```

To delete a key-value pair from the map, you can use the **`delete`** function:

```go
delete(m, "key")
```
