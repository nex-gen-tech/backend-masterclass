# Types of Structs in Go

In Golang, there are two types of structs: named structs and anonymous structs.

A named struct is a struct that has a name and can be referred to by its name in the code. A named struct is defined using the "type" keyword and the "struct" keyword, followed by the struct's name and the list of fields inside curly braces. For example, to define a named struct named "Person" with the fields of "ID", "Name", and "Age", developers can use the following code:

```go
type Person struct {
    ID   int
    Name string
    Age  int
}
```

A named struct can be used to create multiple instances of the struct, each of which can have different values for its fields. To create an instance of a named struct, developers can use the "new" function or the struct's literal syntax. For example, to create two instances of the "Person" struct using the "new" function and the struct's literal syntax, developers can use the following code:

```go
// using the new function
p1 := new(Person)
p1.ID = 1
p1.Name = "John"
p1.Age = 30

// using the struct's literal syntax
p2 := Person{ID: 2, Name: "Jane", Age: 25}
```

An anonymous struct is a struct that does not have a name and can only be used in the place where it is defined. An anonymous struct is defined using the "struct" keyword followed by the list of fields inside curly braces. For example, to define an anonymous struct with the fields of "ID", "Name", and "Age", developers can use the following code:

```go
p := struct {
    ID   int
    Name string
    Age  int
}{ID: 1, Name: "John", Age: 30}

```

An anonymous struct can be used to create a single instance of the struct, and it cannot be used to create multiple instances with different values for its fields. To access the fields of an anonymous struct, developers can use the "dot" notation or the "pointer" notation, just like a named struct. For example, to access the "ID" field of the "p" instance of the anonymous struct, developers can use the following code:

```

// using the dot notation
id := p.ID

// using the pointer notation
id := (*p).ID

```

The types of structs in Go provide different ways to define and use structs in the code. Named structs are useful for creating multiple instances of the struct with different values for its fields, while anonymous structs are useful for defining temporary structs that can be used in specific places in the code. Developers can choose the appropriate type of struct based on their needs and the requirements of the code.
