# What are the types of Fields of a Struct can Hold?

The fields of a struct object in Golang can hold any data type, including basic types, arrays, slices, maps, and other structs. Some common types of fields that a struct object can hold are:

- Basic types: The fields of a struct object can hold basic data types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, booleans, and pointers. For example, to define a struct named "Person" with the fields of "ID", "Name", and "Age" that hold integer, string, and boolean values, developers can use the following code:

```go
type Person struct {
    ID   int
    Name string
    Age  bool
}
```

- Arrays: The fields of a struct object can hold arrays, which are fixed-size sequences of elements of the same data type. For example, to define a struct named "Person" with the field of "Skills" that holds an array of string values, developers can use the following code:

```go
type Person struct {
    Skills [10]string
}
```

- Slices: The fields of a struct object can hold slices, which are variable-size sequences of elements of the same data type. For example, to define a struct named "Person" with the field of "Skills" that holds a slice of string values, developers can use the following code:

```go
type Person struct {
    Skills []string
}
```

- Maps: The fields of a struct object can hold maps, which are key-value data structures that allow developers to store and retrieve values based on their keys. For example, to define a struct named "Person" with the field of "Skills" that holds a map of string keys and integer values, developers can use the following code:

```go
type Person struct {
    Skills map[string]int
}
```

- Other structs: The fields of a struct object can hold other structs, allowing developers to create complex data structures that can store and manipulate related data. For example, to define a struct named "Person" with the field of "Contact" that holds a struct named "Address" with the fields of "Street", "City", and "Country", developers can use the following code:

```go
type Address struct {
    Street  string
    City    string
    Country string
}

type Person struct {
    Contact Address
}
```

The fields of a struct object can hold various data types, providing a flexible and powerful way to store and manipulate complex data in Golang. Developers can choose the appropriate data types for the fields of a struct based on their needs and the requirements of the code.

In Golang, structs can have fields that hold function values, allowing developers to define and use functions as part of a struct. A struct with a field that holds a function value is called a "functional struct", and it provides a convenient way to store and use functions in a structured way.

To define a struct with a field that holds a function value, developers can use the "func" keyword followed by the function's signature inside the struct's definition. For example, to define a struct named "Calculator" with the field of "Add" that holds a function that takes two integer arguments and returns an integer value, developers can use the following code:

```go
type Calculator struct {
    Add func(int, int) int
}
```

To assign a function value to the "Add" field of the "Calculator" struct, developers can use the ":=" operator or the "=" operator. For example, to assign the "add" function to the "Add" field of the "Calculator" struct using the ":=" operator, developers can use the following code:

```go
add := func(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}

c := Calculator{Add: add}
```

To call the function value stored in the "Add" field of the "Calculator" struct, developers can use the "dot" notation or the "pointer" notation, followed by the function's arguments inside parentheses. For example, to call the "Add" function with the arguments of "1" and "2", developers can use the following code:

```go
// using the dot notation
result := c.Add(1, 2)

// using the pointer notation
result := (*c).Add(1, 2)
```

Function types in structs provide a convenient way to define and use functions as part of a struct, allowing developers to organize and manipulate functions in a structured and efficient way. They are a valuable tool for working with complex data and algorithms in Golang.

**Functions as a field**

Structs can have functions as their field. Below is the code showing the usage of function inside a struct.

```go
import (
    "fmt"
)

// declare function type
type FoodNameGetter func(string) string

type Food struct {
    name string
    getter FoodNameGetter // declare a function
}


func main() {
    pizza := Food{
        name: "Pizza",
        getter: func(name string) string {         // declare function body
            return "This is " + name + "."
        },
    }

    fmt.Println(pizza.getter(pizza.name))     // prints "This is Pizza."
}
```
