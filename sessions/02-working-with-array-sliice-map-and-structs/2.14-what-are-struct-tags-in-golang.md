# What are struct tags in Golang?

In Golang, struct tags are metadata that is associated with the fields of a struct. Struct tags are specified in the field's definition as a string literal that follows the field's type, and they can be accessed and used by various tools and libraries, such as the "json" package or the "reflect" package. Struct tags provide a convenient way to add extra information and behavior to the fields of a struct.

To define struct tags, developers can use the "key" and "value" syntax inside the string literal that follows the field's type. For example, to define the struct tag of the "Name" field of the struct named "Person" with the "json" key and the "name" value, developers can use the following code:

```go
type Person struct {
    ID   int
    Name string `json:"name"`
    Age  bool
}
```

To access the struct tags of a field, developers can use the "reflect" package to get the field's "StructField" value and access the "Tag" field. For example, to access the struct tag of the "Name" field of the "Person" struct, developers can use the following code:

```go
typ := reflect.TypeOf(Person{})
fld, _ := typ.FieldByName("Name")
tag := fld.Tag
```

Struct tags are a valuable feature of Golang that allows developers to add extra information and behavior to the fields of a struct. They provide a convenient way to access and use metadata in various tools and libraries, and they are useful tools for working with complex data structures and algorithms in Golang.

### Famous packages in Golang use struct tags

In Golang, some of the famous packages that use struct tags are the "json" package, the "xml" package, and the "gorm" package.

The "json" package is a popular package that provides functions and methods for encoding and decoding JSON data. The "json" package uses struct tags to map the fields of a struct to the corresponding keys in the JSON object. For example, to encode the "Person" struct to a JSON object, developers can use the following code:

```go
type Person struct {
    ID   int `json:"id"`
    Name string `json:"name"`
    Age  bool `json:"age"`
}

p := Person{ID: 1, Name: "John", Age: true}
b, _ := json.Marshal(p)

```

The "xml" package is a popular package that provides functions and methods for encoding and decoding XML data. The "xml" package uses struct tags to map the fields of a struct to the corresponding elements and attributes in the XML document. For example, to encode the "Person" struct to an XML document, developers can use the following code:

```go
type Person struct {
    ID   int `xml:"id,attr"`
    Name string `xml:"name"`
    Age  bool `xml:"age"`
}

p := Person{ID: 1, Name: "John", Age: true}
b, _ := xml.Marshal(p)
```

The "gorm" package is a popular package that provides an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer for working with databases in Golang. The "gorm" package uses struct tags to map the fields of a struct to the corresponding columns in the database table. For example, to map the "Person" struct to a database table, developers can use the following code:

```go
type Person struct {
    ID   int `gorm:"primary_key"`
    Name string `gorm:"column:name"`
    Age  bool `gorm:"column:age"`
}

db, _ := gorm.Open("postgres", "host=localhost port=5432 user=postgres password=postgres")
db.AutoMigrate(&Person{})
```
