# Looping through maps

Maps and loops are often used together in Go. Here are a few examples of using loops with maps:

1. Iterating over the key-value pairs in a map:

```go
for key, value := range m {
    fmt.Println(key, value)
}
```

2. Iterating over the keys in a map:

```go
for key := range m {
    fmt.Println(key)
}
```

3. Iterating over the values in a map:

```go
for _, value := range m {
    fmt.Println(value)
}
```

4. Iterating over the key-value pairs in a map and breaking out of the loop when a certain condition is met:

```go
for key, value := range m {
    if value == 10 {
        break
    }
    fmt.Println(key, value)
}
```

5. Iterating over the key-value pairs in a map and continuing to the next iteration when a certain condition is met:

```go
for key, value := range m {
    if value == 10 {
        continue
    }
    fmt.Println(key, value)
}
```
