# Defining and implementing methods in Structs in Golang

In Golang, structs can have methods, which are functions that are associated with a struct and can be used to manipulate the struct's data and behavior. Methods are defined and implemented inside the struct's definition, and they can be called on the struct's value or pointer.

To define a struct with a method, developers can use the "dot" notation or the "pointer" notation followed by the name of the method and the method's signature inside the struct's definition. For example, to define a struct named "Person" with the method of "SetName", which is used to update the "Name" field of the struct, developers can use the following code:

```go
type Person struct {
    ID   int
    Name string
    Age  bool
    SetName(string)
}
```

To implement the method of a struct, developers can define the method with the same signature as the method's definition inside the struct's definition. For example, to implement the "SetName" method of the "Person" struct, developers can use the following code:

```go
type Person struct {
    ID   int
    Name string
    Age  bool
    SetName(string) {
        p.Name = name
    }
}
```

To call the method of a struct, developers can use the "dot" notation or the "pointer" notation, followed by the name of the method and the method's arguments inside parentheses. For example, to call the "SetName" method of the "Person" struct, developers can use the following code:

```go
// using the dot notation
p := Person{ID: 1, Name: "John", Age: true}
p.SetName("Jane")

// using the pointer notation
p := &Person{ID: 1, Name: "John", Age: true}
p.SetName("Jane")
```

Methods are a powerful feature of Golang that allows developers to define and use functions as part of a struct. They provide a convenient way to manipulate the struct's data and behavior, and they are a valuable tool for working with complex data structures and algorithms in Golang.

### What are "global methods" or "free functions‚Äù and how to implement them?

In Golang, "global methods" or "free functions" are methods that are defined and implemented outside the struct's definition. These methods are not associated with a specific struct, and they can be used to manipulate the data and behavior of any struct that has the required receiver type. Global methods provide a convenient way to reuse and extend the functionality of structs in a more modular and reusable way.

To define a global method, developers can use the "func" keyword followed by the method's name, receiver, and signature outside the struct's definition. For example, to define a global method named "SetName" with a receiver of "\*Person" and a signature of "SetName(string)", developers can use the following code:

```go
type Person struct {
    ID   int
    Name string
    Age  bool
}

func (p *Person) SetName(name string) {
    p.Name = name
}
```

To call a global method, developers can use the "dot" notation or the "pointer" notation, followed by the name of the method and the method's arguments inside parentheses. For example, to call the "SetName" method on the "Person" struct, developers can use the following code:

```go
// using the dot notation
p := Person{ID: 1, Name: "John", Age: true}
p.SetName("Jane")

// using the pointer notation
p := &Person{ID: 1, Name: "John", Age: true}
p.SetName("Jane")
```

Global methods are a valuable feature of Golang that allows developers to define and use methods outside the struct's definition. They provide a convenient way to manipulate the struct's data and behavior in a more modular and reusable way, and they are a useful tool for working with complex data structures and algorithms in Golang.
