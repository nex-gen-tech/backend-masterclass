# Embedded structs and pointers

In Golang, structs can be embedded in other structs, allowing developers to reuse the fields and methods of the embedded struct in the outer struct. An embedded struct is called an "anonymous field" in the outer struct, and it provides a convenient way to extend the outer struct with the features of the embedded struct.

To define a struct with an embedded struct, developers can use the "dot" notation or the "pointer" notation followed by the name of the embedded struct inside the struct's definition. For example, to define a struct named "Person" with the embedded struct of "User", developers can use the following code:

```go
type User struct {
    ID   int
    Name string
}

type Person struct {
    User
}
```

To access the fields and methods of the embedded struct in the outer struct, developers can use the "dot" notation or the "pointer" notation, followed by the name of the field or the method of the embedded struct. For example, to access the "Name" field and the "SetName" method of the "User" struct in the "Person" struct, developers can use the following code:

```go
// using the dot notation
p := Person{User: User{ID: 1, Name: "John"}}
name := p.Name
p.SetName("Jane")

// using the pointer notation
p := &Person{User: User{ID: 1, Name: "John"}}
name := p.Name
p.SetName("Jane")

```

Embedding a struct in another struct is a powerful feature of Golang that allows developers to reuse the fields and methods of other structs and avoid duplication in the code. It provides a convenient way to extend the functionality of a struct and organize and manipulate complex data structures in a more efficient and maintainable way.
